    <h1>The Story of Berners-Lee by  OPENAI'S CHATGPT</h1>
    <p>In the early 1990s, Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist working at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research),envisioned a way for scientists to share and collaborate on research documents more efficiently. At that time, information sharing on the internet was limited, and there was no user-friendly platform for accessing and contributing to documents.</p>
    <p>In 1990, Tim Berners-Lee proposed a system called the World Wide Web (WWW) that would use hypertext to enable users to navigate between documents. He developed the first website and browser while working at CERN, creating the foundations for what we now know as the internet.
    </p>
    <p>The first website ever created was <a href="http://info.cern.ch">info.cern.ch.</a> It was a simple page that explained the World Wide Web concept and provided information about how to create web pages. This page served as both the first website and the first web server.
    </p>
    <p>This story underscores the transformative power of an idea, persistence in the face of challenges, and the potential of technology to bring about positive change. Tim Berners-Lee's contributions to web development have had a profound and lasting impact on the world. </p>
